# An Era Ends.
@everyone

Hey, happy! Since I have too much to do and can't keep nexocrew up to date with new content, I want to close it for now. The domain and Github will remain for other projects. Nexocrew still exists, just this Discord is no longer there, but we and I will continue to use it as a development platform. We will split it up into our individual projects and then do Crystopia and Disbot. Some things will be migrated to xyzspacd.dev and also to DevelopmentStorage on Github. **Moonlight** will stay, and everything else will stay, too. This Discord is no longer active and will be deleted this weekend so I don't have to stress about it. And the website will also no longer exist, or rather, go offline. We'll see what happens, but I don't have enough time to equip Nexocrew with software. That's why xyzspace.dev is for projects and other software solutions, or there's a separate Discord + organization, but otherwise

* https://github.com/DevelopmentStorage
* https://github.com/xyzspace-dev

There might be another Discord if there's a reason, but otherwise I prefer Github or a Discord for the project. Or a discussion via Github.

It was a great time.
Cheers xyzjesper and the Nexocrew Team

PS.: This organisation will remain for the code but nothing else and everything will be moved to xyzspace.dev and the new private organisation for code.
